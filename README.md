## Welcome to Project Comet
The purpose of Project Comet was to develop a reusable technical asset to demonstrate how an insurance company can leverage the IBM Hybrid Cloud Portfolio in a heterogeneous and hybrid environment while also highlighting the architectural shifts from SOA to microservices.

## Business Problem:
The point in time that a person (or entity) is requesting a quote for insurance the insurance company has some predictable questions that they are asking themselves:

1. Mutable, the rules I have in place today may not be the rules I want in place tomorrow, I need a flexible solution so I can rapidly deploy new rules quickly. 
2. How do I reduce the time between a business decision of changing/adding/deleting a current rule to the point in time that is running in production? What would be the impact if you couldn’t?
3. Is there a severe weather event that is occurring or about to occur in that geographic location?

## Our Solution: 
to create a reusable industry specific demo for clients that contains multiple products in the Hybrid Cloud Portfolio: API Connect, ODM, Weather Services, Cloudant DB, IBM Cloud & DevOps.  We wanted to put these products in their sweet spots! The solution architecture is both on-prem/off-prem.  We created Cloud Foundry applications written in Node.js and have three running on IBM Cloud and one running in a Docker container. 

Our solution highlights the architectural shifts from SOA to microservices to show that we understand both and how they can co-exist.  Our goal was for this to accelerate IBM’s success in Cloud and to target developer communities.
